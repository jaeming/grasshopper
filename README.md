# Grasshopper API

A messageboard API served up as JSON by **Ruby on Rails** and consumed by **AngularJS**.

I started this project to learn more about building a RESTful API in Rails.
Then, I began to experiment with building a front-end using AngularJS to better understand how both ends actually connect.

## TODO:

##### Back-end
- algorithm for top boards & messages (recent activity)
- search feature

##### Front-end
- success messages for create and delete
- 403 messages, etc...
- better re-directs after create and delete
- convert user controller to a factory service
- edit boards and messages
- look at loading messages in a more optimized way
- new board form as modal
