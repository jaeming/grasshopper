# Grasshopper API

A messageboard API served up as JSON by **Ruby on Rails** and consumed by **AngularJS**.

I started this project to learn more about building a RESTful API in Rails.
Then, I began to experiment with building a front-end using AngularJS to better understand how both ends actually connect.

## TODO:

##### Back-end
- algorithm for top boards & messages (recent activity)
- search feature???

##### Front-end
- success/error messages
- convert user controller to a service (log in & log out)

Finish re-creating CRUD actions with the new service:
  - edit boards and messages
  - delete Boards and Messages
