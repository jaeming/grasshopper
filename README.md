# Grasshopper API

A messageboard API served up as JSON by **Ruby on Rails** and consumed by **AngularJS**.

I started this project to learn more about building a RESTful API in Rails.
Then, I began to experiment with building a front-end using AngularJS to better understand how both ends actually connect.

The API is live:
grasshopperapi.herokuapp.com

Or the Angular Front-end can be found here:
http://104.131.112.121/

Repo for angular front-end is found here:
http://github.com/jaeming/Grasshopper-angular

## TODO:

##### possible Back-end features to add:
- algorithm for top boards & messages (recent activity)
- search feature???

##### Front-end:
- success/error messages, better re-directs.

Finish re-creating CRUD actions with the new service:
  - delete Boards and Messages
